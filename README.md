# 02393-Programming-in-cpp
## Course contents
The course teaches C++ for the working programmer. The focus is on how to make use of the C++ constructs and libraries for the most common kinds of problems in an efficient way and to write programs in an elegant and abstract way. This includes the effective use of C++ constructs and concepts as well as how to apply good engineering principles in C++.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, students should be able to:

* Select and use data types.
* Define and construct data structures and functions, including recursive, dynamic data structures and recursive functions.
* Use principles of structured program design and methods.
* Describe and use containers and iterators.
* Construct and demonstrate generic functions and classes (templates).
* Use and define classes with encapsulation and constructors.
* Use pointers and arrays with memory management.
* Develop projects organized in multiple header and source files.
* Explain and apply the principles of abstract data types.
* Analyze and compare the complexity of different data structures and algorithms
explain the C++ runtime system.
